There are many kinds of people who say this, but i have divided it into two categories. </p>\n<h3>1. The New Financial Literates.</h3>\n<p>These are the kind of people who have finished reading a book like “Rich Dad Poor Dad” , and suddenly becomes financial experts and take the quotes from the book “House is a Liability”. But, do you really know what is the business the author is doing. He is into Real Estate. He owns more than 3500 properties. Yeah, you heard it right , he owns more than 3500 liabilities. Now, comes the second type of people.</p>\n<h3>2. The Loan Phobia guys.</h3>\n<p>These are the people who will say that you don’t own a home, you own a so much loan, you will hate yourself for rest of your life. Loan is a trap , its a monster , bla bla bla. But, do you know how much debt is in Reliance Industries , the company of Richest person in India. It has a debt of 1,54,478 crores as on 2019, at the time of writing this article. Yeah, you heard that right. Having a debt for starting something or for owning an asset which will put money in your pockets later, is really not such a bad idea.</p>\n<p>There is one more kind of people, my favourite kind and because of whom , i have decided to write this blog, those who say that</p>\n<h3>Renting is cheaper than owning.</h3>\n<p>Now, let us run some numbers and see if that is really true. I have two properties, one of which i believe is an asset , and other one is neither a liability , nor an asset. Let us crunch some numbers and see whether it is really an asset or a liability.</p>\n<p>Now i bought a small 2 BHK house for 31 lakhs , and did a downpayment of 10%, and loan of 20 years for the rest of 90% amount. Now, my monthly EMI comes at around 24k per month at current rate of interest. I get a rent of around 15k per month by renting it out. </p>\n<p><img src=\"./33893097-e5a70c34-df5a-11e7-8f5e-40e057626770.png\" alt=\"test\"></p>\n<p>Proin suscipit luctus orci placerat fringilla.
