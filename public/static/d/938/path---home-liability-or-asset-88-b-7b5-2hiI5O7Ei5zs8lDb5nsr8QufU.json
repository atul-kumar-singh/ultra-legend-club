There are many kinds of people who say this, but i have divided it into two categories. </p>\n<h3>1. The New Financial Literates.</h3>\n<p>These are the kind of people who have finished reading a book like “Rich Dad Poor Dad” , and suddenly becomes financial experts and take the quotes from the book “House is a Liability”. But, do you really know what is the business the author is doing. He is into Real Estate. He owns more than 3500 properties. Yeah, you heard it right , he owns more than 3500 liabilities. Now, comes the second type of people.</p>\n<h3>2. The Loan Phobia guys.</h3>\n<p>These are the people who will say that you don’t own a home, you own a so much loan, you will hate yourself for rest of your life. Loan is a trap , its a monster , bla bla bla. But, do you know how much debt is in Reliance Industries , the company of Richest person in India. It has a debt of 1,54,478 crores as on 2019, at the time of writing this article. Yeah, you heard that right. Having a debt for starting something or for owning an asset which will put money in your pockets later, is really not such a bad idea.</p>\n<p>There is one more kind of people, my favourite kind and because of whom , i have decided to write this blog, those who say that</p>\n<h3>Renting is cheaper than owning.</h3>\n<p>Now, let us run some numbers and see if that is really true. I have two properties, one of which i believe is an asset , and other one is neither a liability , nor an asset. Let us crunch some numbers and see whether it is really an asset or a liability.</p>\n<p>Now i bought a small full furnished 2 BHK house for 31 lakhs. After making a downpayment, and loan of 20 years, the monthly EMI comes at around 24k per month at current rate of interest. I get rent of around 14k per month by renting it out. </p>\n<p>I live in bangalore, and here rent increases by around 10% every 11 months , because every 11 months the rental agreement gets renewed. Now for the sake of calculation, lets assume , it gets renewed every year i.e in 12 months.\nYou can check the rent calculator from here <a href=\"./rent-savings-calculator/\">Rent Calculator</a></p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/rentCalculations-1498fc354259cb8ada6e3f860bfa7f70-5e314.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 101.53417015341701%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAYAAACNiR0NAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAACP0lEQVQ4y5WUW4/SUBDH+Z4afTAx2YS4D5hVN+uT2VW/gD6r2ZWbaLIaH0wgUZFAYgKmW25S7gKl3AuF3v52iiUgpzVOMzntufzOf2bOqQ+WCaMq7ibu4dG3UwTiRziMB/AgfoLA5RHufzyG/+0dXAvdwK3YbVyP3MTBGz9Ovz7GWfopzlJPcPz5IfyfDlGQivARUJRFXPBBhPNRhAphnPOvEfv5DkEujBffX+Ky9gHhchTRcgyhUsT6fo+LH0E8+/IcEWtNpBjFq6tztKe/4DNNEzCxNqf9Y+pUhdTqg2W6rKNRaux2WutthbquQ1kpkOcyDNOApmvWmImu2IVQE2BYj2ZoG6cxURLB8RwWysIeV3XVXmcDDcPqUFUoirLeyFxL7Xa7qFQqmz7H7TSJInK5HJbL5WachO0AF4vFDrDX66HZbDKBw+EQpVIJq9XKHfi3wk6nA0EQmEBJkpDP592Bmqb9V8gO0DPk+Xy+B3RT2O/3wfO8t8LpdLoXsptCAnIc5w2czWY7wFarhWKx6BqyZ5VZCqnKjUaDCRyNRqhWq3aq9oD0wgJSDuv1uqvCQqHgrXAymewBa7WaK/CfRWEByVnA8XhsF4wZsltRqMpuIROQbopnyDRpG0hHg84hfdMcp3U2oyq7KqRc0P10YM59bbfbzN+XLMsol8ubqIjBvMsEpFym02kkk0mkUilks1m7JTipymQySCQS9rGhyAhEThzftiLHaBJVkVJATmduMBjYG5Jq+nVROrbDdew32fbxFeb8xhoAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"Rent Calculations\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/rentCalculations-1498fc354259cb8ada6e3f860bfa7f70-48538.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/rentCalculations-1498fc354259cb8ada6e3f860bfa7f70-bed0f.png 200w,\n/static/rentCalculations-1498fc354259cb8ada6e3f860bfa7f70-5fd34.png 400w,\n/static/rentCalculations-1498fc354259cb8ada6e3f860bfa7f70-48538.png 800w,\n/static/rentCalculations-1498fc354259cb8ada6e3f860bfa7f70-b70ec.png 1200w,\n/static/rentCalculations-1498fc354259cb8ada6e3f860bfa7f70-5e314.png 1434w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Now, lets dig into the conclusions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The EMI which is i am paying will remain almost the same, however the rent which will be asked will increase by 10% every year. </li>\n<li>After 7 years , the rent which i receive will be greater than the EMI which i will be paying. </li>\n<li>For the calculations perspective i have assumed 20 years , but even after finishing my loan , still i will be getting rent each year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apart from these things, there are also few other factors to consider </p>\n<ul>\n<li>I will also get the tax benefits on the interest amount which i pay , as well as on the principal amount.</li>\n<li>If after 20 years i want to sell the apartment, i will be able to pay that for much appreciated value</li>\n<li>If the inflation is more the money which you borrowed from the bank at lower interest become more cheap , or deprecates in value, but the rents on the other hand increases as inflation increases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Yeah, yeah but what about the other things. There are always other things</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maintenance</strong> After the tenant has moved in, he/she is responsible for maintaing the property. In my stay in rental properties, i have not seen any lanlord paying the maintenance after tenant has moved.</li>\n<li><strong>Cool Off Period</strong> The tenant has to give you a notice of 1 month, this time is more than enough to find new tenants.</li>\n<li><strong>Damages</strong> If there is any kind of damage to the property , that amount will be deducted from the Deposit</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Still, if you think a house is a liability , then think again.</h3>\n<p>Is a rental property always a good option, or is any kind of investment in real estate always good. No, it is not. To be fair enough, lets look at the downside of owning a property</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to start your own business at some point of time, after few years , then investing in property will not be a good option, because in the initial years , the money will go out of your pocket, cash flow will be outwards. It will be difficult to start something with EMIs going on.</li>\n<li>You need a high amount for downpayment.</li>\n<li>It is not as liquid as stocks, since it is not possible to sell it anytime whenever you want to.</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/home-liability-or-asset/","prefix":"2019-10-06"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Is your house an asset or a liability","author":"Atul Singh","category":"Real Estate","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/house-2c622f26dc2e71cc8b63669830cacb50-ada8c.jpg"}}}}},"authornote":{"id":"3e95ea34-6216-56b3-9d24-9229b2e71581","html":"<p><strong>Mr. Gatsby</strong> Proin ornare ligula eu tellus tempus elementum.
